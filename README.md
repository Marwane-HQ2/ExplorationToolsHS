# ExplorationToolsHS 🧭
A project made for the event High Seas organized by StartHackClub, this project was made to help me learn more about JS, HTML and CSS.
It's my first time coding in HTML and CSS out of school, and freely ! Ans it's also my first time coding in JS for a website, I've already coded in JS but I essentially followed tutorials so I haven't gone deep into how JS works.
I will try updating this project alongside my learning of JS (and HTML/CSS of course !)
